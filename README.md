A repository for my Love2D games. 

Every game or sketch has it's own branch; master branch contains shared libraries and distribution scripts.

Launching `distribute.bat` will create a .zip with a portable win32 copy of love2d, a .love file with all the source code, and `update-executable.bat` which can be used to create a convenient executable.
